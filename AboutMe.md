# MANIKANTA GADDAMEDA
I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenge and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive toward. I'm not comfortable with settling, and I'm always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness. In my previous role, I was promoted three times in less than two years
my intrests are reading books playing badminton
